# Vulnerability Capstone

By: Onyedikachi Okoh

Deploy the vulnerable machine attached to this by pressing the green "Start Machine" button. It is **recommended** that you use the TryHackMe AttackBox to complete this room.
(I used my own Attack machine) 

Allow **five minutes** to pass before attempting to attack the vulnerable machine **10.10.91.243**

Answer the questions below

1. Deploy the vulnerable machine attached to this task & wait **five minutes** before visiting the vulnerable machine.

ANS: CVE:[**2018-16763**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16763)

1. Use the resources & skills learnt throughout this module to find and use a relevant exploit to exploit this vulnerability.
    
    **Note:** There are numerous exploits out there that can be used for this vulnerability (some more useful than others!)
    
    Download the CVE proof-of-concept to your machine and updated the required configuration with the target URL: [`http://10.10.254.22`](http://10.10.254.22(use)

A. I attempted to run the exploit but encountered an error: the directory I was looking for didn’t exist and only the `system` directory was visible. 
I searched for other FUEL CMS exploits using Google dorks and found one on GitHub

B. Prepare a listener on your attacker host to accept an incoming reverse connection. Copy and Save the GitHub proof-of-concept as `exploit.py` and fill in the required fields (victim IP and listener port) with the values for your authorized test target.
